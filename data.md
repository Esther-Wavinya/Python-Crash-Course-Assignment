## Data Analytics and Statistics
**Raw data** is a group of values that you can extract from a source. It becomes useful when it is processed to find different patterns in the data that was extracted. 

These patterns, also referred to as **information**, help you to interpret the data, make predictions, and identify unexpected changes in the future. 

This information is then processed into **knowledge**. Knowledge is a large, organized collection of persistent and extensive information and experience that can be used to describe and predict phenomena in the real world.

**Data analysis** is the process by which you convert data into information and, thereafter, knowledge. Data analytics is when data analysis is combined with making predictions.

There are several data analysis techniques available to make sense of data. One of them is **statistics**, which uses mathematical techniques on datasets.


**Statistics** is the science of collecting and analyzing a large amount of data to identify the characteristics of the data and its subsets. For example, you may want to study the medical history of a country to identify the most common causes of illness-related fatality. You can also dive deeper into
some subgroups, such as people from different geographic areas, to identify whether there are specific patterns for people from each area.

Statistics is performed on *datasets*. Different data inside datasets have different characteristics and require different methods of processing. Some types of data, such as name and label, may be **qualitative**, which means it provides `descriptive information`. Others, such as `counts and amounts`, are **quantitative**, which means you can perform `numerical operations`, such as addition or multiplication,
on these values. 


## Types of Statistics
Statistics can be further divided into two subcategories: **descriptive statistics** and **inferential
statistics**.

**Descriptive statistics** are used to describe a collection of data. For example, the average age of people in a country is a descriptive statistics indicator that describes an aspect of the country's residents.

Descriptive statistics on a single variable in a dataset are called `univariate` analysis, while descriptive statistics that look at two or more variables at the same time are called `multivariate` analysis. In particular, statistics that look at two variables are called `bivariate` analysis. 

The average age of a country is an example of univariate analysis, while an analysis examining the interaction between GDP per capita, healthcare spending per capita, and age is multivariate analysis.


In contrast, **inferential statistics** allows datasets to be collected as a sample or a small portion of measurements from a larger group, called a population. Inferential statistics are used to infer the properties of a population-based on the properties of a sample. 

For example, a survey of 10,000 people is a sample of the entire population of a country with 100 million people. Instead of collecting the age of every person in the country, you survey 10,000 people in the country and use their average age as the average age of the country.


### Methods of Descriptive Statistics
basic mathematical techniques of univariate and bivariate analyses and how to use them to describe and understand a given dataset. You will be introduced to the following methods in this order:

**Univariate Analysis Techniques**
- Data Frequency Distribution
- Quantiles
- Central Tendency
- Dispersion


**Bivariate Analysis Techniques**
- Scatterplots
- Linear Trend Analysis and Pearson Correlation Coefficient
- Interpreting and Analyzing the Correlation Coefficient
- Time Series Data
